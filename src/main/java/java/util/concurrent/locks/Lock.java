/**
 * {@code Lock} implementations provide more extensive locking
 * operations than can be obtained using {@code synchronized} methods
 * and statements.  They allow more flexible structuring, may have
 * quite different properties, and may support multiple associated
 * {@link Condition} objects.

 * 提供比synchronized更方便、更丰富的锁管理。

 *
 * <p>A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by
 * multiple threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a
 * shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and
 * all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be
 * acquired first. However, some locks may allow concurrent access to
 * a shared resource, such as the read lock of a {@link ReadWriteLock}.

 * Lock用来控制多线程对共享资源的访问，通常一把锁只能被一个线程获取，
 * 即共享资源同一时刻只能被一个线程访问。但也有支持多个线程并行访问
 * 共享资源的锁，比如ReadWriteLock。

 *
 * <p>The use of {@code synchronized} methods or statements provides
 * access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but
 * forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way:
 * when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite
 * order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which
 * they were acquired.

 * 在使用synchronized对方法或语句进行并发控制时，实际上是利用对象身上
 * 隐含的monitor lock。
 * 因为使用方式的关系，在使用synchronized时，锁的释放，一定是跟锁的获取顺序
 * 相反的。

 *
 * <p>While the scoping mechanism for {@code synchronized} methods
 * and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks,
 * and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks,

 * synchronized的使用方式，使得它非常易用，也避免了很多锁相关的编程
 * 问题。

 * there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more
 * flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing
 * concurrently accessed data structures require the use of
 * &quot;hand-over-hand&quot; or &quot;chain locking&quot;: you
 * acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A and acquire
 * C, then release B and acquire D and so on.  Implementations of the
 * {@code Lock} interface enable the use of such techniques by
 * allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes,
 * and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any
 * order.

 * 有些场景下，你希望有更灵活的使用锁的方式。比如：在并发的访问一个
 * 数据结构，尤其是遍历访问时，有些算法希望能够实现链式加锁，获取一
 * 个节点的锁进行处理，然后获取下一个节点的锁并释放当前节点的锁，依
 * 次进行。

 * 本接口Lock的实现，可以提供你需要的更灵活的锁使用方式。

 *
 * <p>With this increased flexibility comes additional
 * responsibility. The absence of block-structured locking removes the
 * automatic release of locks that occurs with {@code synchronized}
 * methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom
 * should be used:
 *
 * <pre><tt>     Lock l = ...;
 *     l.lock();
 *     try {
 *         // access the resource protected by this lock
 *     } finally {
 *         l.unlock();
 *     }
 * </tt></pre>

 * 更多的灵活性意味着更多的责任。显式地锁控制，意味着我们要自己去释放
 * 我们获取的锁。
 * 通常情况下，把锁的释放放到finally代码块里是个好主意。

 *
 * When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be
 * taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is
 * held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the
 * lock is released when necessary.

 * 写代码时要额外注意，执行了获取锁的代码，就一定要执行释放锁的代码。

 *
 * <p>{@code Lock} implementations provide additional functionality
 * over the use of {@code synchronized} methods and statements by
 * providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock ({@link
 * #tryLock()}), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be
 * interrupted ({@link #lockInterruptibly}, and an attempt to acquire
 * the lock that can timeout ({@link #tryLock(long, TimeUnit)}).

 * 本Lock提供三种synchronized不支持的加锁方式：
 *     不阻塞的trylock();
 *     可被中断的lockInterruptibly();
 *     可指定超时时间的阻塞加锁tryLock(long, TimeUnit); 

 *
 * <p>A {@code Lock} class can also provide behavior and semantics
 * that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock,
 * such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock
 * detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics
 * then the implementation must document those semantics.

 * 基于本Lock的自定义锁。还可以实现加锁排队，不可重入、死锁检测等更多
 * Synchronized不支持的功能。

 *
 * <p>Note that {@code Lock} instances are just normal objects and can
 * themselves be used as the target in a {@code synchronized} statement.
 * Acquiring the
 * monitor lock of a {@code Lock} instance has no specified relationship
 * with invoking any of the {@link #lock} methods of that instance.
 * It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use {@code Lock}
 * instances in this way, except within their own implementation.

 * Lock实例也是普通的对象，也有monitor lock，也可以使用synchronized进行
 * 同步。但Lock对象的monitor lock和它本身代表的锁，没有任何关系。

 * 为了避免疑惑。建议不要讲synchronized和本Lock的实现混用。

 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a {@code null} value for any
 * parameter will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being
 * thrown.
 *
 * <h3>Memory Synchronization</h3>

 * 内存同步

 *
 * <p>All {@code Lock} implementations <em>must</em> enforce the same
 * memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor
 * lock, as described in section 17.4 of
 * <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>:

 * 本Lock接口的所有实现，都必须保证跟synchronization的内存同步语义一致。
 * 内存同步细节，可见Java语言规范17.4节。

 * <ul>
 * <li>A successful {@code lock} operation has the same memory
 * synchronization effects as a successful <em>Lock</em> action.
 * <li>A successful {@code unlock} operation has the same
 * memory synchronization effects as a successful <em>Unlock</em> action.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
 * locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory
 * synchronization effects.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>

 * 实现考虑 

 *
 * <p> The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
 * non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance
 * characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation
 * qualities.  Further, the ability to interrupt the <em>ongoing</em>
 * acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given {@code Lock}
 * class.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define
 * exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of
 * lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an
 * ongoing lock acquisition.  An implementation is required to clearly
 * document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
 * locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as
 * defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
 * acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on
 * method entry.

 * 三种加锁方式，可能有不同的性能、等待线程顺序、或其它实现特性。
 * 线程的加锁过程是否能够被中断，取决于Lock的具体实现。

 *
 * <p>As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
 * interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
 * to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
 * shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
 * the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.
